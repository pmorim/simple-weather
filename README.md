# Simple Weather App

A simple weather application made with React as an example/challenge for the SISTCA course. It consists of a simple TextField where the user can input the name of a city to get the current weather data.

## The API

We use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) to get the weather information.
For simplicity's sake, we only display the current temperature and an icon that represents the local weather of the given city, but it can be easily changed do display more data, such as:

- Coordinates
- Country
- Timezone
- Humidity
- Pressure
- Wind Speed and Direction
- Sunset and Sunrise
- and many more...

See the [API docs](https://openweathermap.org/current) for more infromation.

It should be noted that other APIs could be used instead of OpenWeather.
